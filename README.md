🌟 Excited to Share My Progress at Cognifyz Technologies 🌟

I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed Level 2 of my Data Analyst internship at Cognifyz Technologies 🎉

In this internship, I am tasked with solving three levels, comprising a total of 11 tasks, centered around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset. Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished in 𝐋𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 2 :



𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 : Delved into the ratings of various restaurants to uncover trends and insights.

𝐂𝐮𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐛𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 : Analyzed popular cuisine combinations to understand customer preferences.

𝐆𝐞𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 : Conducted an in-depth geographical analysis of the dataset.

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐬 : Explored the distribution and characteristics of various restaurant chains.

For these analyses, I leveraged Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Geopandas, and Folium to perform data analysis and visualization. This hands-on experience has significantly enhanced my data analytics skills and my ability to draw meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Looking forward to tackling the final level and continuing this exciting learning journey! 🚀
